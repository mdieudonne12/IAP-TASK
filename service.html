                    <h4>UI/UX Design</h4>
                    <p>The design of my personal portfolio website is clean, easy to use, and focused on showing my work clearly. I used simple layouts and smooth navigation so visitors can move through the site without confusion. The website works well on all screen sizes, from phones to desktops. I chose easy-to-read fonts, soft colors, and enough space between sections to make everything look neat and professional. Every part of the design is made to help people understand who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch with me</p>

                        <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
                        <p>Frontend development is all about building the parts of a website that people see and interact with. It includes everything from layout and design to making buttons, menus, and animations work smoothly. As a frontend developer, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My goal is to turn ideas and designs into real, working web pages that look good on any device and provide a great experience for users.</p>

                            <h4>Backend Development</h4>
                            <p>Backend development focuses on the behind-the-scenes parts of a website or application that users donâ€™t see but are essential for everything to work properly. It involves working with servers, databases, and APIs to manage data, handle requests, and make sure everything runs smoothly and securely. As a backend developer, I build the logic and structure that power the frontend, using tools like Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB or MySQL. My goal is to create fast, reliable, and scalable systems that support great user experiences.</p>
